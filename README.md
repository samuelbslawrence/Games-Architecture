You will produce a 3D maze game and a game engine developed from the provided Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework. You will also critique and evaluate your design in terms of performance against an Inheritance design.

The object of the game is to collect 3 keys that will allow you to switch on an exit portal that will allow you to escape an enemy drone robot. The game will be rendered in 3D.
